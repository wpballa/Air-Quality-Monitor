# Air-Quality-Monitor

This project monitors the temperature, humidity, and air quality of 1.0 mm and 2.5 mm particulates every 5 minutes, placing the results in a log file for later inspection. A Pimoroni scrollphathd displays the current 2.5 mm data.

With wildfires cropping up all over the world due to climate change, a personal air quality monitor is very useful to know whether you should refrain from exercising or wear a mask just to go outside. This sensor won’t quite agree with the official ones that are mounted 5 meters above the ground, but the numbers aren’t that far off and numbers over 100 are pretty unhealthy.
